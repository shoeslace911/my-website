        <h5>About this blog</h5>
        <p>This is the part of the page where we skip the formalities and just talk about random things that  happened in my life lately and share it to random people in the internet, pretty sure that's safe and I won't totally regret that at all.<br></p>
        <p>This is also the part of the page where I become unprofessional and just speak to all of you as friends</p>

        <h5>About me... again</h5>
        <p>My name is Sho Fujiwara and I have been studying Frontend development for a good year and a half with HTML first then CSS... and with Javascript well..... I couldn't really grasp it but I think I understand what it's trying to do. </p>
        <p><br> My life has really just been about studying langugaes, let it be music, computers and well... human languages. I was born and raised in the Philippines but moved to Japan in 2018 with my dad, learned the Japanese language for around 2 years, got good at it and then studied more of it for a year and then I studied computer languages, HTML and CSS for a year, got good at it too but never really put it to the test because I was discouraged to make mistakes. So I had to repeat the things I already knew again and again and again never really learning new things.</p>
        <p><br>I love learning... It's always something when I learn something new and apply it, sure there are somethings that are frustating to learn, sure it could stress you out, sure it might not be worth it but once you figured it out, the satisfaction you get is... nice... It's the power of knowing that keeps me going, as I always say<br><p>
